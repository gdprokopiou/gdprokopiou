## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning what Github, how to use it, and how it can help me with my work.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with **IDE** Test Engineering team, as well as Electronics, Software, Mechanical, RF and Systems Engineering teams, on various projects currently running or scheduled to run within **IDE**, in the near future!
